-- Get team names with a subquery

/* Instructions 1/2
Create a query that left joins team to match in order to get the identity of the home team. This becomes the subquery in the next step.
*/

SELECT 
	m.id, 
    t.team_long_name AS hometeam
-- Left join team to match
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN team as t
ON m.hometeam_id = team_api_id;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Instructions 2/2
Add a second subquery to the FROM statement to get the away team name, changing only the hometeam_id. Left join both subqueries to the match table on the id column.
Warning: if your code is timing out, you have probably made a mistake in the JOIN and tried to join on the wrong fields which caused the table to be too big! Read the provided code and comments carefully, and check your ON conditions!
