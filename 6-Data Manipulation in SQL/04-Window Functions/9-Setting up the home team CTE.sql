/* Instructions
Create a CASE statement that identifies each match as a win, lose, or tie for Manchester United.
Fill out the logical operators for each WHEN clause in the CASE statement (equals, greater than, less than).
Join the tables on home team ID from match, and team_api_id from team.
Filter the query to only include games from the 2014/2015 season where Manchester United was the home team.
