-- Putting the CTEs together
/* Instructions
Declare the home and away CTEs before your main query.
Join your CTEs to the match table using a LEFT JOIN.
Select the relevant data from the CTEs into the main query.
Select the date from match, team names from the CTEs, and home/ away goals from match in the main query.
